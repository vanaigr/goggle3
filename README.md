# WIP

This is a prototype for an app that serves the same purpose as [Google refresh 2023](https://github.com/vanaigr/google-refresh-2023) 
and [goggle2](https://github.com/vanaigr/Goggle2), namely: to create a fast, keyboard-first interface to google search.

Basically this:

but a standalone app that can be opened at any point with a keyboard shortcut, instead of having to open the browser window and a new tab.
